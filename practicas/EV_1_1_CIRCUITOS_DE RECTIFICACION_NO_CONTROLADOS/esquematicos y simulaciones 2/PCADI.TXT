P-CAD Schematics Translator for Capture 7.10
8/22/97


Priorities addressed for the current release:

1. Insure net list integrity between P-Cad and Capture
2. Provide a path for library translation using the PDF format.
3. Support all version of PDF format

Items yet to be addressed:

1. Hierarchical schematics are not supported.
2. User definable attribute mapping of external attributes
   is not supported.
3. Use of a cross reference file is not supported.
4. Non-orthogonal pin placement needs to be improved.
5. The translator does not automatically place pins on grid.
6. Editing of some P-Cad translated parts may be difficult
   due to pin grid and bounding box issues.

User Notes:

1. The translator and associated PCADI.INI should be located in
   the Capture directory.
2. The translator may be activated from Capture by selecting the File
   Import option and choosing the PDIF tab.
3. The translator will ignore items that are set to invisible
   when the PDF file is generated.  If you wish to use the grid
   settings P-Cad, make sure they are visible prior to PDF 
   generation.  Please be aware that these grids will not be 
   consistent with those found in Capture. 
4. Net names appear at (0,0) to preserve P-Cad system generated
   names and user generated names.
5. The PCADI.INI file contains a list of possible power and ground
   symbol names, as well as off page connector names.  Please make
   sure that all power and ground symbols as well as offpage connector
   names are in this file.
